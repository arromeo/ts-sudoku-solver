# TypeScript Sudoku Solver

As the title suggests, this project is a Sudoku puzzle solver built using TypeScript and React. I had built a similar project in Python last year, but have made some major improvements in this iteration including more solid OOP principles, proper puzzle validation with highlighting, generic functions that could handle updates to rows, columns or blocks rather than repeating loops, and helper functions to produce cleaner, more readable code.

The main focus on this project was to learn and get comfortable with using TypeScript. I'm happy with how this project turned out, and it has really put a fire in my belly to update all of my projects with TypeScript and also has me more interested in exploring OOP languages like C# and Java.

## Run Locally

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To install this project locally you will need to have Node.js installed along with the npm package manager. You can find instructions for installing this for your respective OS [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

### Installing

1. Clone this project onto your local machine using the Git CLI or download the .zip file and extract the files into an empty directory.
2. In a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the project files and run `npm install` to download and setup the project's dependencies.
3. Run `npm start`. After building the project, a browser window should automatically pop up, but if not, the default URL is `http://localhost:3000`.

## Built With

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) - Programming Language
* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - Front-end Framework
* [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) - Project Setup
* [Immutable.js](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/) - State Updating

## Contributing

Being that this was my first attempt at a TypeScript project, I'm certain there are mistakes that were made and patterns that were missed. I would be very appreciative to hear some critical analysis of my code to help me be a better programmer and to improve faster.
